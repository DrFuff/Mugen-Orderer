# Mugen-Orderer
A batch file made to compare character AI in MUGEN and more.  This project has been "condemned" while I construct
another project in C# with the same goals.  Anyone is welcome to take this code and rework it for their needs.
You may even distribute the code if you may desire.

# How to Use
There are some files that were used for testing i have left in that don't need to be there.
If you want use the command you will need to edit the variables at the top of the file.
Line prompts will not work.
